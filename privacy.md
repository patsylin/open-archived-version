# Privacy Policy

Archive Reader does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

The extension only reads the active tab’s URL when the user clicks the toolbar button or context menu item, in order to open the newest archived version of that page. The user’s preferred archive provider (Wayback Machine or Archive.ph) is saved locally in Chrome’s sync storage.

No data is sent to external servers other than the chosen archive provider’s public archive service, and this is only done when the user initiates the action.
